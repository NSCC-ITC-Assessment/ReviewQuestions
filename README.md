# Grill My Code

A GitHub Action that analyses code changes and uses AI to generate targeted comprehension questions for conversational or written assessments.

## How it works

1. Detects the commit range from the triggering event (push, pull request, etc.)
2. Collects the git diff of changed files, applying include/exclude filters
3. Sends the diff to an AI provider to generate comprehension questions
4. Writes the assessment to a Markdown file, and optionally posts it as a PR comment, GitHub Issue, or GitHub Discussion

See [architecture](https://nscc-itc-assessment.github.io/GrillMyCode/docs/development/architecture) for a detailed breakdown of how the action is structured and executed.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Inputs

| Input                    | Required | Default                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Retries are triggered by transient errors: 429 (rate limit), 500, 502, 503, 504, and network-level failures. A 429 with a `Retry-After` header has that value honoured. Values below 1 are clamped to 1.                 |

Lower values produce more predictable, consistent questions; higher values produce more varied output. Most users should leave this at the default.                                                      |

When `false`, uses the empty tree as the base so the initial commit's files are included in the diff regardless of event type.                                                                |

## Example workflows

Ready-to-use workflows for each configuration are available in the [example workflows](https://nscc-itc-assessment.github.io/GrillMyCode/docs/category/example-workflows) section of the docs site. Copy the relevant YAML into `.github/workflows/` in your repository.

### Pull request (recommended)

Generates questions whenever a student opens or updates a PR, and posts them as a PR comment.

```yaml
name: Code Assessment
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  generate-questions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write # required to post the PR comment
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # full history required for diff resolution

      - uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          num_questions: '5'
          additional_context: 'Assignment 3 — Python list comprehensions'
```

### Push to branch

Generates questions on every push. Useful when students work directly on a branch without opening a PR.

```yaml
name: Code Assessment
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: [main, master]

jobs:
  generate-questions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # required to write the output file to the repo
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          post_pr_comment: 'false'
          output_file: 'grill-my-code.md'
```

### Post to GitHub Issues

Creates a searchable GitHub Issue for each assessment run. If an issue already exists for the same branch, its body is updated in-place rather than deleted and recreated, preserving issue history and comments.

```yaml
jobs:
  generate-questions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          post_issue: 'true'
          post_pr_comment: 'false'
```

### Post to GitHub Discussions

Creates a Discussion instead of (or as well as) a PR comment. If Discussions are not yet enabled on the repository, the action enables them automatically. The named category must already exist.

```yaml
jobs:
  generate-questions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      discussions: write
      administration: write # required only if Discussions may not yet be enabled
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          post_discussion: 'true'
          discussion_category: 'Assessments'
```

### Using a third-party AI provider

```yaml
- uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ai_provider: 'openai'
    ai_model: 'gpt-4o'
    api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    num_questions: '8'
    additional_context: 'Web Development — REST API design with Express.js'
```

## GitHub Classroom

This action is designed to work with GitHub Classroom. By default (`skip_initial_commit: 'true'`), the diff base is pinned to the repository's very first commit — the template/starter code committed by Classroom. This means only code written by the student after accepting the assignment is assessed, and template boilerplate is never included in the diff.

In addition, the `skip_committers` input (defaulting to `github-classroom[bot],github-actions[bot]`) automatically advances the base past any consecutive bot commits that appear immediately after that first commit — for example, the feedback pull request or autograder setup commits that Classroom applies when a student accepts an assignment.

Set `skip_initial_commit: 'false'` to include the initial commit's files in the diff — the base is pinned to the empty tree regardless of event type, so all files from the very beginning of history are eligible to be assessed. To include truly everything (bot-committed starter files as well), also set `skip_committers: ''` to prevent the base from being advanced past those initial bot commits.

## Output file naming

All assessment files are written under the `_assessment/` folder. Any directory component of the `output_file` setting is ignored — only the basename is used. On the default branch (`main`/`master`) the file keeps the configured basename; on any other branch the sanitised branch name is appended before the extension:

| Branch            | `output_file` setting | Actual file written                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `main`            | `grill-my-code.md`    | `_assessment/grill-my-code.md`                 |
| `feat/login-form` | `grill-my-code.md`    | `_assessment/grill-my-code-feat-login-form.md` |
| `student/a1`      | `assessment.md`       | `_assessment/assessment-student-a1.md`         |

---

## Using action outputs

The action exposes two outputs for use in later steps:

```yaml
- uses: NSCC-ITC-Assessment/GrillMyCode@v1
  id: assess
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Upload assessment
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v6
  with:
    name: assessment
    path: ${{ steps.assess.outputs.output_file }}

- name: Print questions
  run: echo "${{ steps.assess.outputs.questions }}"
```

---

## Exclude patterns behaviour

The default `exclude_patterns` list covers common non-code files (lock files, images, build artefacts, minified assets). **Providing a custom value completely replaces this list** — it does not extend it. If you want to add patterns while keeping the defaults, you must repeat them:

```yaml
exclude_patterns: 'node_modules/**,**/*.lock,dist/**,tests/**'
```
